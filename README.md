# Avalon

This is a clone of the Avalon board game.
It's an experiment to intentionally use socketIO as a replacement for REST wherever possible - to push socketIO to the limit and explore limitations.

It uses Flask python3 server on the backend, with ReactJS on the frontend.

```
python3 server.py
```

And visit <http://localhost:5000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!
